        <h1><a href="/mk2-vr6-starting-out.html">1990 VW Jetta Engine Swap - Starting Out</a></h1>
        <p>This is my first post of a hopefully not-too-long running project series.</p>
<p>The end goal of this project is to replace the original 1.8 liter 4-cylinder motor in my 1990 Volkswagen Jetta (Mk2) with a 2.8 liter VR6 engine.  By today's standards, neither motor is particularly powerful.  However, horsepower is not what I'm after...</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The VR6 engine is pretty unique.  It's not quite a V6, but it's also not an inline 6 either.  But it's kind of both, too.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0LKWt3Ttic">Here's a great video</a> that describes the design of the engine and what makes it unique.
While the design of the engine is quite novel, the sound it produces is what makes it truly special:</p>

<p>While there are plenty of inexpensive VWs on the market that come with the VR6 already, I figured it would be more fun and a better learning experience to do an engine swap instead.
The second-generation (Mk2) Golf/Jetta was never offered with a VR6, however many enthusiasts have swapped the VR6 into the Mk2 chassis since it is a <em>relatively</em> easy process.  As a result, there are tons of resources for this swap available on the internet and within various VW communities across the world.  I will certainly be relying on my VW friends and various internet resources throughout the process.</p>
<h2>Procuring the project car</h2>
<p>I spent a couple of months scouring Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, etc. for a suitable car that was within my budget of $2500 or less.  This proved to be quite difficult, since I was looking for ~30 year-old cars.  After checking out a couple of absolute turds, I began seeking alternatives.  Not too long after that, a couple of friends notified me of a 1990 Volkswagen Jetta GL that was going up for sale.  The engine and body were in surprisingly good shape.  A friend drove me to check out the car.  After some inspection and a quick test drive, I bought car for $1600.  I drove it home (~40 minutes) without any major issues.</p>

<p><img alt="Rear view of the white 1990 Jetta" src="/images/jetta002.jpg"></p>
<p>While the car is in good overall condition for its age, there are a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a couple of rust spots.  One under the rain tray below the windshield, and another below the trunk lid.</li>
<li>The rear passenger-side door handle doesn't work, and most of the rest of the door handles should probably be replaced as well.</li>
<li>There's a coolant leak, which seems to be due to a bad seal on the water pump.  You can even see a puddle below the license plate in the first picture.</li>
<li>The exhaust rattles while driving.  The seller had already purchased a new rubber exhaust hanger, but I bought the car before they had a chance to install it.</li>
<li>There's a fairly loud humming noise coming from the passenger-side rear wheel.  Presumably a bad wheel bearing.</li>
<li>The speedometer reads absurdly high.</li>
<li>The radiator fan works, but the wiring is pretty hacked up.</li>
<li>The interior smells like the car has been sitting outside for a few years (which it has).  The seats and carpet could use a deep-clean, along with the seatbelts.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these issues are pretty minor fixes.  Some of which I will be indirectly addressing as a result of swapping parts out from other cars for the engine swap.</p>
<h2>Project Planning</h2>
<p>I mentioned the swap process is relatively easy, but that's not necessarily true for someone like me with such limited experience working on cars.  There's a lot that goes into this project, and it's important to be organized.  I've created a couple of Trello boards to help me track my progress and ensure that I'm covering all of my bases.  I have one board to track the tasks that need to be completed, and another to track the parts and tools that I need to procure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/b/lalq28zE/mk2-jetta-vr6-swap-tasks">Tasks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/b/aZhuJZH4/mk2-jetta-vr6-swap-parts-tools">Parts &amp; Tools</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These boards will be the best place to go for the most current progress of the project.  I'll do my best to provide updates in this blog as some of the larger and more interesting tasks are completed.</p>

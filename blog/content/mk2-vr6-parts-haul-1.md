Summary: I got some MK3 parts for the MK2 VR6 swap, and address some broken parts from the donor Passat

I picked up a couple of parts for the MK2 last week.  I needed a k-frame, which is needed to support the rear of the VR6 in the MK2.  This part came off of a MK3 Golf.  I also needed a pair of front knuckles from a MK3, which would allow me to upgrade to larger front brakes.  The salvage place was too lazy to split everything up, so they gave me full front brake assemblies and control arms (still attached to the k-frame).  The whole assembly was too heavy and cumbersome for me to unload from my car, so I pulled the brake stuff off of the control arms.

##Front brake upgrade
My plan is to upgrade the front brakes to the VW Corrado G60 setup, which has 11" rotors and maintain the original 4x100 lug pattern.  The Corrado calipers are not compatible with stock MK2 knuckles because the carriers cannot be removed from the knuckles.  The MK3 (2.0L) knuckles have removable carriers and are otherwise the same as MK2, so they will work with the Corrado calipers.  A friend of mine says they might have a set of Corrado calipers for me, so I'm hoping they'll be able to pull through on that.

Since I'm swapping knuckles, I figured it was a good idea to replace the wheel bearings and hubs as well.  I've yet to order them, but I've added these parts to my [shopping list](https://trello.com/b/aZhuJZH4/mk2-jetta-vr6-swap-parts-tools).  I'm probably going to wait until I get the Corrado brakes before I buy the remaining brake parts.

##VR6 Harness issues
The wiring harness that goes between the fuse box, ECU, and main engine harness connector is in rough shape.  It looks as if it were cut at some point, since most of the wires have been spliced together with butt connectors.  This could be the source of numerous headaches in the future, so it's probably best that I don't use it.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a direct replacement harness for this engine and ECU combination.  I reached out to a friend of mine in Alabama who always has two or three VW projects going on at any given time.  He mentioned that he's tearing a bunch of parts out of a 1996 Passat VR6, and that I'm welcome to have anything that I need from it.  Long story short, he's sending me a harness for an OBD2 VR6, along with most of the necessary parts to convert my VR6 to OBD2 along with some other goodies.  I'll be sure to post an update once that stuff arrives.

##More damaged parts
I also noticed that the front crossmember is broken.  The engine mount half has a broken mounting ear, which is a structural part.  It could probably be welded back together, but since it's responsible for supporting the engine, I'd rather replace the whole crossmember.  I reached out to someone who has one for sale locally, but haven't heard back yet.  Hopefully they pull through, otherwise I'm back to scouring the internet for the part I need.  There's a really nice [tubular crossmember made by Fabless Manufacturing](https://www.fablessmanufacturing.com/products/tubular-front-cross-bar-vw-mk2-corrado), but it's pricey compared to the Passat part.

That's most of last week's news.  I did some more work on the VR6 over the weekend, which I'll post about soon.  Stay tuned.

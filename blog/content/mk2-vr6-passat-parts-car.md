Summary: Introducing the parts car - a B3 Passat VR6

The parts Passat has arrived!

If you've seen the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/aZhuJZH4/mk2-jetta-vr6-swap-parts-tools) where I'm tracking parts & tools, you may have noticed that a few items have a green label that says "B3 Passat Parts Car".  Well, I finally received the car from which I'll be pulling those parts - A 1993 VW Passat GLX.

A friend of mine bought this car a while ago, as they needed some parts for their [Corrado](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzrPRYkH4S0/).  They were generous enough to let me pull most of the suspension out of it to use on [my car](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzM0R3rHtXR/) for last year's [Gambler 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler_500).  They no longer needed the Passat, so I bought it for $400.  The Gambler car (along with it's "upgraded" suspension) has since been given away to another friend, so the Passat had to be transported with some makeshift struts to allow the car to roll on/off the trailer.  As you can see in the above picture, it's not exactly an ideal suspension setup.  Alas, the car is in my driveway and ready to be pulled apart.

## Parts list
There are a number of parts that I plan to take from this car:

* Pedal cluster
* Front cross member (radiator support)
* Front cross member (motor mount)
* Engine - 12v VR6 (AAA, OBD1)
* Transmission - 02A
* Accelerator cable
* Shifter box
* Shifter cables
* Bolts - you can never have too many spare bolts lying around

## Pulling the pedal cluster
The first item to come off of the Passat is the pedal cluster.  The MK2 Jetta's clutch is cable-actuated, while the Passat's is hydraulically actuated.  Since I'm swapping a different transmission into the MK2, the pedal cluster needs to match the new transmission's clutch setup.  The cluster from this Passat should bolt up to the MK2 Jetta's firewall with little-to-no modification needed.

I was pretty eager to start ripping the Passat apart, so I didn't take any pictures to document the process of removing the pedal cluster.  I'll try to do better next time.  Anyway, the process went something like this:

* Remove the knee bar that makes up the lower section of the dashboard
* Move the A/C ducting that runs above the steering column.  The ducting might have been below the column; I don't quite remember.
* Disconnect the throttle cable, brake pushrod/return spring, pedal position sensors (vacuum and electrical connections), clutch pedal pushrod
* Disconnect the steering column U-joint that joins it to the steering rack.  This allows the column to pivot freely, with the pivot axis being just below the instrument cluster.
* Remove the 7 or 8 nuts that attach the pedal cluster to the firewall.  I had to peel back the carpet in the foot well to access the lower mounting points.
* Pull the pedal cluster out.  It was a bit challenging to wrangle it out with the steering column in the way. Disconnecting the U-joint from the steering column certainly made the process easier.

I have the luxury of junking this car when I'm done with it, so I don't have to worry about reinstalling any parts on the car, nor do I need to be very careful when removing things to access the parts I need.

## Next steps
I'm not sure if I'm going to use the engine from this car or not.  There's another car I want to buy for parts, which may have an engine and trans that are in better shape.  Either way, I need to pull the engine out of this car to access some other parts that I need.  Hopefully I can have that done by the end of this coming weekend (you can track my progress [here](https://trello.com/c/uK80BA4y/56-remove-passat-engine-transmission)).  More details to follow.

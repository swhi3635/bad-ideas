Summary: Removing years of dirt, grease, and other crap from the engine that's going into the MK2 Jetta

Last week I took some time to pull some parts off of the VR6 so I could clean it up a bit.  Over 25 years of (ab)use makes for an awfully dirty engine.

The aluminum intake manifold was heavily oxidized, so I pulled that off first:

I started to scrub it down with some degreaser, but stopped about halfway through after realizing I was going to replace this manifold with one that I'm getting from a friend...  I ended up calling it a night after this, and picked everything back up a few days later.

## Cleaning the engine block
I was eager to start cleaning up the engine block, so I didn't do a ton of preparation.  I'm planning to put the engine on a stand and remove some of the extraneous components to allow me to do a more thorough cleaning.  For this go-around, I just plugged up any holes where water doesn't belong and covered up any electrical connectors that were exposed.  I reinstalled the spark plug wires thinking that would reduce the risk of water damaging the plugs, but I'm going to replace the spark plugs anyway...

Here are some before shots:

I spent the next 30 minutes or so scrubbing the block with a nylon brush, a brass brush, and a healthy dose of degreaser.  I started running out of elbow grease and my standards lowered as a result.  Nonetheless, the engine is much cleaner than before.

As you can see, the aluminum bits cleaned up a lot better than the iron and steel components did.  It turns out there was a nice layer of rust underneath all of that dirt and grease.  I'm not sure if I'm going to go through the hassle of cleaning up all of that rust and repaint the block or not.  It's not a super high priority at this point.

##Cleaning the valve cover & lower intake manifold
The upper intake manifold (first picture in this article) is the centerpiece of the engine bay, so it needs to be at least somewhat presentable.  I'm hopeful that the manifold that my friend sends me is in good shape, since it can be a bit of a pain to clean up.  Either way, the lower intake manifold and valve cover both needed attention.  Removing the valve cover was pretty straightforward, and separating the fuel rail from the lower intake manifold wasn't too bad either.

A noticeable improvement, but it's far from perfect.  I'm considering painting the intake manifolds and valve cover matte black, since that should help prevent further oxidation and I think it would look quite nice.  Something like this:

##For next time
As mentioned above, I'd like to put the engine on a stand so I can rotate it for easier cleaning.  I ordered a stand, but it may be a couple of weeks before it arrives.  In the meantime, I'll be removing various components from the engine block so I can replace the gaskets, seals, and any other potential wear items.  I also have lots parts to buy!

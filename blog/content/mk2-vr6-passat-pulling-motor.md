Summary: Pulling the engine and transmission out of the Passat parts car

While it's becoming more likely, I still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to use the engine and transmission from the Passat to put into the MK2 Jetta.  The Passat has a fairly unknown history, but the engine supposedly runs despite some issues with the starter.  What I'm really after is the pedal cluster, the front cross members (for the motor mount and radiator), and a few other bits and pieces.  I have to pull the engine to remove the front cross members anyway, so I'll have the engine handy should I decide to use it.

## Preparation
I did a bit of prep work before ripping things out of the engine bay to ensure that I wouldn't miss anything.  Namely, I made a [checklist](https://trello.com/c/uK80BA4y/56-remove-passat-engine-transmission) comprising of the major steps needed to get the engine out.  Most of this came straight from the Bentley service manual for the 1995-97 Passat.  I had a digital copy of the manual on my phone, which I referred to along the way.  Some of the nomenclature was a bit strange, but I was able to follow along reasonably well.  By the way, I *highly* recommend picking up one of these service manuals up if you ever decide to do some DIY work on your car.  Additionally, I had a sticky note with some key page numbers on it, so I could quickly jump back and forth between sections, since the page numbers on the PDF didn't line up with the page numbers in the book.

I gathered some self-sealing bags, some tape, and a marker so I could keep track of the nuts and bolts that I'd be pulling off of the car.  This makes it super easy to find whatever bolts I need when I need to install them on the Jetta.  Here's what my collection looked like after the engine was out:

Once I was ready to get started, I placed a couple of large pieces of cardboard under the car to avoid dripping fluids onto the driveway.  I had a large plastic pan handy for the steps that involved draining fluids as well.

## Getting everything out of the way
Pretty much every step of this process involves taking something off of the car, or cleverly getting it out of the way without removing it entirely (e.g. the A/C system).  Since this car has been messed with quite a bit in the past, some pieces were already removed (nothing critical, thankfully).

![Engine - before starting]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/engine_before001.jpg)

I'll walk through the checklist linked above:

1. Disconnect throttle cable from the throttle body at the top of the intake manifold.  I was planning to use this on the Jetta, but it's in pretty rough shape.  A new one can be had for ~$30, so I'll probably pick up a fresh one when I order my first batch of parts.
2. Remove the spark plug wires and the plastic guide that keeps then nice and tidy.  There's supposed to be a guide for the top 3 wires, but it was missing.

    ![Spark plugs, wires, guides removed]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/spark_plugs_wires_removed001.jpg)

3. Remove the air box and intake hose.
4. Remove the serpentine belt.  By inserting a bolt into the top of the tensioner, you can create enough slack to pull the belt off without much fuss.

    ![Belt tensioner with bolt]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/tensioner001.jpg)

4. Remove lock carrier with attachments.  I wasn't sure what this even meant at first, but I later realized it's the radiator support.  I removed the upper portion, which involved removing the front bumper cover, front grill panel, and headlights.

    ![Front end with lock carrier removed]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/lock_carrier001.jpg)

5. Disconnect the power steering system.  I didn't want to drain the system so I could avoid any potential messes with the power steering fluid.  Although, I'm going to have to drain the system eventually anyway...
    1. Loosen the clamp that holds the reservoir up against the radiator and slide the reservoir out.
    2. Unbolt the line retainers on the front engine mount and transmission.  This allowed the lines to move freely underneath the car.

        ![Power steering hard lines hanging below engine]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/power_steering_lines001.jpg)

    3. Remove the power steering pump.  There were 5 bolts (3 front/pulley side, 2 rear) holding the power steering pump up to the bracket attached to the engine block.  I used a pry bar to get the pump out of the bracket, since it was a bit stuck.

        ![Front view of power steering pump]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/power_steering_pump001.jpg)

        ![Rear view of power steering pump]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/power_steering_pump002.jpg)

    4. Move the pump put of the way.

        ![Power steering pump disconnected]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/power_steering_pump003.jpg)

6. Drain coolant.  There's a coolant pipe that runs along the front of the engine block with a drain plug in it.  This is best accessed from beneath the car.

7. Disconnect 42-pin connector near ignition coil.
8. Disconnect all wiring from transmission, alternator, starter.

9. Disconnect all coolant, vacuum, and breather hoses from engine.  I disconnected upper radiator hose, various hoses from the side of the engine, the "custom" heater core hoses, throttle body, and a few others.  I don't remember all of the exact hoses that I removed, but those were the main ones.

10. Disconnect fuel lines from fuel rail and tie them off.

    ![Fuel lines tied off]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/fuel_lines003.jpg)

11. Separate oxygen and knock sensor connectors from the rear engine mount.  There was a heat shield in the way that needed to be removed as well.

    ![Oxygen and knock sensors]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/oxygen_knock_sensors001.jpg)

12. Unbolt CV axles from the flanges on the transmission and tie up out of the way.  I took the front wheels off to gain easier access.  On the driver side, it was easiest to unbolt the axle via the wheel well.  On the passenger side, I had to get under the car, since the flange was pretty much at the center of the engine bay.  It was a bit difficult to get my triple square socket fully seated in the bolt heads since some were full of crud, which caused me to almost strip one of them.  So if you're doing this on your own, I recommend triple checking that you have your socket fully seated before trying to loosen the bolts!  Another trick is to stick a screwdriver into the brake rotor vents through the caliper so you the axle doesn't rotate when you're trying to loosen the bolts.  Once the axles were disconnected, I used bungee cords to hold them up and away from the transmission.

13. Remove the front exhaust pipe (downpipe) from the exhaust manifold.  This was pretty tricky, as the 6 bolts were very difficult to remove.  Lots of WD-40 (penetrating oil would have been ideal) and elbow grease was needed.  I was able to get a couple of the top nuts out from above the engine with a basic open end wrench. I got the rest of the bolts from beneath the car, using a combination of socket extensions, wobble attachment, and a breaker bar.  It's not uncommon to snap the studs off of the manifold when trying to undo the nuts.  Luckily that didn't happen to me.  Despite unbolting the downpipe from the manifold, the flanges seem to have bound to each other.  I ended up waiting to break the downpipe free until I started pulling the engine out of the car so I would have more room to wiggle it free.

14. Disconnect the vacuum hose between the intake manifold upper section and the fuel pressure regulator.  I ended up breaking a T-fitting in the process.

    ![Broken vacuum hose fitting, fuel pressure regulator]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/vacuum_hoses002.jpg) 

15. Remove manifold absolute pressure sensor from the upper intake manifold.  As far as I could tell, there was no MAP sensor on the car.  I just took off the rest of the intake hose connected to the manifold.

    ![Intake hose]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/intake_hose001.jpg) ![Intake hose, removed]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/intake_hose002.jpg)

16. Remove radiator, fan, and shroud.  After disconnecting the cables from the fan and sensor attached to the radiator, I separated the fan/shroud/radiator from the AC condenser.  I didn't have enough room to get the radiator out, so I started the process of removing the AC system so I could get some more room.  In hindsight, I should have removed the lower part of the radiator support (lock carrier) which probably would have allowed me to slide the radiator/fan/shroud out from underneath the car.

17. Remove the AC condenser, reservoir, and compressor and move them out of the way.  This process can be done without disconnecting any lines, thus eliminating the need to purge the system and potentially release dangerous gasses into the atmosphere.  The reservoir lives behind the passenger side headlight, and I just needed to remove a couple of bolts to allow it to hang freely and provide extra slack on the AC lines.  The condenser attaches to the radiator, as mentioned in the previous step.  The compressor is attached to a bracket on the engine block, since it's driven by the serpentine belt.  There's only 2 bolts securing it to the bracket, but they're rather long.  The lower bolt was too long to remove entirely, because the frame was in the way.  I had to loosen the front and left-rear engine mounts and raise the engine using a floor jack to pull, which allowed the bolt to clear the frame and be removed.

18. I removed the alternator and serpentine belt tensioner at this point, which may not have been necessary.

## Removing the engine and transmission
1. Ensure that all hoses, wires, etc. are disconnected from the engine and out of the way.

    ![Engine ready to be removed from the car]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/engine_removal001.jpg)

1. Secure the engine hoist to the engine and lift slightly

    ![Engine hoist attached, supporting the weight of the engine]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/engine_removal004.jpg)

2. Undo the bolts from the engine and transmission mounts.

    ![Rear engine mount]({lightbox}b3-passat-vr6-engine-removal/engine_removal007.jpg)

3. The manual stated to disconnect the engine carrier and pry the spacer out.  I think this is a bracket that holds the power steering lines in place near the batter box.  This bracket wasn't present on this car.
4. Pull the engine out of the car.  I went back and forth between raising the engine a little bit at a time, then pulling the engine towards the front of the car.  I checked multiple times for any wires/cables that I may have forgotten to disconnect, as well as anything that might get in the way of the engine.  I removed the front engine mount support from the front cross member to free up some extra space as well.  After about 5 minutes, I had the engine out entirely.

## Conclusion
This process took about 10 hours spread across 3 days.  I'm confident that I could do this again in far less time.  A few things I wish I knew/would do differently for next time:

* If it's in the way, just remove it.  I lost time trying to work around different things in the engine bay that were easy to remove and would have freed up valuable space.
* Read the instructions all the way through at least 5 times.
* You don't have to do everything in order
* Wear eye protection, especially when working under a car.  The safety aspect is obvious, but it's also super annoying to have dirt falling into your eyes when working under a car.  I wore eye protection most of the time I was under the car, but not every time. 
* I wish I'd taken more pictures and captured more detailed notes of what I was doing as I was doing it.

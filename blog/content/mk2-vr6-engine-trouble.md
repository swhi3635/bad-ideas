Summary: Separating the head from the block to take a closer look at the condition of the donor VR6.

Last week I put the engine on a stand and continued to take it apart.  After pulling the cylinder head off the block, I made an unfortunate discovery.

## Getting the VR6 on an engine stand
I ordered an engine stand a couple of weeks ago, but it was taking forever to ship due to COVID-19 delays.  A friend of mine was kind enough to let me borrow their stand in the meantime.

Since I wanted to attach the engine to the stand using the rear mounting points, it made sense to remove the transmission to avoid having too much weight hanging off of one side of the stand.  I also needed to access the timing chains, which requires you to remove the transmission anyway.

I was planning to replace the clutch, but it looks like that was done recently.  The flywheel might need to be resurfaced though.

After removing the transmission, I attached the engine stand bracket to the rear mounting points.  I could only manage to attach it using 3 of the 4 arms, but this seems to be fairly common practice with these engines.  I bought some bolts at the hardware store since the bolts for the rear engine mount weren't long enough.  If I remember correctly, the bolts are M10x1.5 and 75mm in length.  I needed several washers as well.

Once the bracket was on, I hoisted the engine up and attached the engine stand to the bracket.  Then I lowered the engine such that the stand was supporting the full weight of the engine.  Voila!

## Removing the head
I decided to removed the head so I could get a better idea of the condition of some of the engine internals.  Since the previous owners had clearly done some haggard work on the wiring harness and a number of other parts of the Passat, I wasn't very confident that this engine was in good shape.  

I removed the upper timing cover, camshafts, and valve lifters.  With the upper timing cover camshafts removed, I was able to do a quick inspection of the upper timing chain and guide, which are in remarkably good shape.  These must have been replaced around the same time the clutch was replaced.  I then removed the 20 bolts that secure the head to the engine block and pulled the head off.

Let's take a closer look at a couple of the pistons...

![piston damage]({lightbox}vr6-engine-damage/piston-damage001.jpg) ![piston damage]({lightbox}vr6-engine-damage/piston-damage002.jpg)

All 6 pistons have very clear markings where the exhaust valves made contact with the piston crowns.  This is indicative of the engine's timing being off at some point, which can have catastrophic consequences.  The VR6 is an interference engine, meaning the valves and the pistons take up the same space in the combustion chamber.  So if the engine timing is off, the valves and pistons can collide.  This usually results in bent valves and damaged pistons, at the very least.  There's a great [Jalopnik article](https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-interference-engines-are-and-why-they-exist-1823935549) that goes into more detail about interference engines.

After inspecting the head, there don't seem to be any bent valves.  Interesting...

My theory is that the timing chain tensioners failed, causing the timing chain to jump and put the engine out of time.  This caused the valves to hit the pistons and bend the valves.  The owner then replaced the head, along with the timing chains, guides, and tensioners.  I was told that this engine ran before I got it, so I imagine it would run if I put everything back together.  However, I highly doubt that the engine would run _well_.

## Next steps
I have a few options:

- Put this engine back together as-is, damaged pistons and all.  I'd still replace all of the one-time-use items like the gaskets, o-rings, head bolts, etc.  I'd also replace the cooling components so those tend to wear out.
- Replace the pistons and rings, which would require the block to be further disassembled, taken to the machine shop, and more.  This would be pretty expensive and time consuming.  I'd also probably have the head serviced at the machine shop as well.  Then replace all of the gaskets, etc. as I mentioned above.  The upside to all of this extra cost and time would be a well-refreshed engine that I could rely on for quite a long time.
- Find another engine.  This is likely the fastest, easiest, and probably the cheapest option depending on the condition of the engine I find.  Another upside is that I could keep the damaged engine and rebuild it later, without holding up the rest of this project.

I'll most likely pick up another engine, since I'm eager to keep this project moving forward.  Stay tuned.

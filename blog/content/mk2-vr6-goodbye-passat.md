Just a quick update.  The Passat is finally gone!

I got sick of having a pile of junk taking up valuable driveway space, and I'm sure my neighbors were tired of looking at it.  So, this weekend, I took off the remaining parts I needed, along with some extra just-in-case stuff:

Front cross members

Downpipe

Fusebox

Some of these parts will need a through cleaning.  The wiring harness is in pretty rough shape, but hopefully it's salvageable.  I need to send it off to be modified to work with the Jetta, and I imagine I'll have to pay a bit extra to take care of the hackjob that was done on it by one of the previous owners.  The fusebox wasn't really needed, but I figured it's good to have on hand, just in case.

Here's a shot of the Passat being hauled away.  Good riddance!
